  - Greetings, young warrior! I am Stjarna, a warrior taken to Valhalla long ago.
  - The ring you took and wear on your finger has summoned me from Odin's halls to
    aid you in your quest.
  - I've seen the state your village is in and I've decided to help!
  - Is your path blocked? let me lend you a hand.
  - See that big rock with the mark on it? Thanks to my strength you'll be able to
    move it!
